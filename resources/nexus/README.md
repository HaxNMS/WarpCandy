Tired of that ugly warp effect that looks like the universe is puking through a
straw onto your face? Me too. Have some WarpCandy.

WarpCandy is not just a tweak of the vanilla FX. That raisin was dried up.
This is a brand new bag of jellybeans. It rebuilds the hyperdrive warp effect
from the ground up with some sweet new FX and visual enhancements.

WarpCandy comes in a variety of flavours to choose from. Pick your favourite
or switch it up for a tasty treat.

Screenshots do not do the WarpCandy FX any justice.

Features:
- eliminates the 'looking through a straw' effect of the vanilla tunnel
- a brand new high-res model re-designed for new and improved effects
- all new, higher-res textures for greater variety and less scrolling repition
- more texture layers for richer FX with better depth, parallax scrolling and 
other visual complexity


[color=#FFFF00][b]There are currently 4 flavours available:[/b][/color]
- [b]Dark[/b] (A classic, dark warp effect)
- [b]Nebulon[/b] (Blast through the Orion nebula)
- [b]Matrix[/b] (Hax your way through the NMS digital universe)
- [b]Alien Enema[/b] (Hitch a ride in the bowels of an inter-dimensional space whale)


I have some more ideas cooking still but suggestions/requests are also welcome.
Keep in mind that there are limits to what can be done without a lot more work.
- I can't fix the abrupt transition when entering and exiting warp.
- I can't reproduce the Star Wars, elastic warp effect.
- I can't reproduce anything like the Interstellar warp, yet. WarpCandy v2?
- Yes! I can probably do the Spaceballs ludicrous (plaid) warp. It's on the list.

Other modders are welcome to use the assets to make your own WarpCandy FX
that you can share however you like, with proper credit to Gaticus Hax.
Send me a link and I'll include it on the WarpCandy page at NexusMods.


[size=5][color=#FF0000]INSTALLATION:[/color][/size]
Choose ONE of the WarpCandy flavours from the MAIN FILES category in the 
NexusMods page downloads section.

If you've never installed a mod before, be sure to:
- delete or rename GAMEDATA\PCBANKS\DISABLEMODS.TXT
- create the GAMEDATA\PCBANKS\MODS\ directory

Unzip the mod and put the pak file in GAMEDATA\PCBANKS\MODS\

Enjoy.


[size=5][color=#FF0000][u]SMALL[/u] CHANCE OF POSSIBLE CONFLICTS:[/color][/size]
WarpCandy is designed to have a minimal footprint in the vanilla assets to
minimize potential conflicts.

The only vanilla asset that is modified is:
[size=3][b]MODELS\EFFECTS\WARP\WARPTUNNEL.SCENE.MBIN[/b][/size]

WarpCandy uses some custom shaders. Shaders are different than typical
vanilla assets, having much more ways to potentially conflict between mods.
Although the WarpCandy shaders are unique from the vanilla shaders, they are
still dependent. There will not be any direct shader file conflicts
but other shader mods in different files may make general changes that
could effect WarpCandy, never the other way around though.

In the small chance you have problems with WarpCandy because of another
shader mod then rename one of the two mods so that WarpCandy is loaded
[b]before[/b] the other mod.
